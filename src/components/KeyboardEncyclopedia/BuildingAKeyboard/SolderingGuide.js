        Soldering is the process of joining two or more items together by
        melting and putting a filler metal (solder) to into the joint, forming a
        joint between the components.

      <PageParagraph>
        Solder is a low melting point metal alloy used to join two things
        together. Solder provides an electrical and mechanical connection
        between the two things - with regards to keyboard construction, this
        would be the metal switch pins and the PCB's switch pads.

        Solder is typically made out of a mix of tin and lead. Leaded solder
        helps the solder melt at a lower temperature and flow nicely;
        conversely, lead-free solder melts at a higher temperature and flows
        quickly which increases the risk of poor joints. Therefore, a mix of
        tin/lead is very much preferred - a good tin/lead ratio is <i>60/40</i>{" "}
        or <i>63/37</i>. In some parts of the world such as Europe, leaded
        solder is banned. However, some European sellers on eBay sell genuine
        leaded solder - if given the choice, it would be best to purchase leaded
        solder over lead-free solder.

      <PageParagraph>
        Solder often contains a core inside the solder wire containing flux.
        Flux helps to improve electrical contact and mechanical strength in
        solder joints. Two types of flux are mainly used - acid core and rosin
        core. Acid core is used for plumbing, whereas rosin core is used for
        electronics. Therefore, only rosin core solder should be used for our
        purposes.

        Solder also comes in a variety of diameters. For soldering switches,{" "}
        <i>0.8mm (0.0131 inches)</i> is recommended. For soldering smaller
        components such as SMD parts, a smaller diameter of{" "}
        <i>0.5mm (0.02 inches)</i> is recommended, though soldering SMD parts
        requires greater soldering skills.

        A solder iron is the equipment used to melt the solder and create joints
        between the component and the PCB. A recommended temperature for
        soldering is between 350째C (662째F) to 370째C (698째F), depending on the
        ambient temperature.
